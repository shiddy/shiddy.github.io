Summary: About Shiddy.io

## Where am I?

I started this blog so that I could store documentation for things that didn't stay in my head.

In time it's turned into a place for me to express what I am passionate about and what's been on my mind.

## Who are you?

I find learning new things, and distilling that information to others gratifying. I've always loved technology since I was a kid. Consequently, most of my life has been around trying to get computers to do what I want.

I studied computer science and work mostly with security. I've given up on trying to sound smart or correct. I want to solve hard problems spend time with people that share the same disposition.

## Why Shiddy?

I was irony-poisoned; Cool sounding names never seemed to fit. "Shiddy" stuck when playing a game with friends and I always thought it was more funny, and more suited in my efforts of thumbing my nose at all the aliases online.
