Summary: About Shiddy.io

I initially started this blog so that I could have some stored documentation that I was doing something important with my time. However, in time it's turned into a place for me to express to others things that I am passionate about, or what I've been thinking about. 

*What you might find here*

* My musings on living in a computing world
* Expressing computer concepts in a way that a younger me would have grasped
* Efforts in computing I want to share
* Things my future self won't want to look up

**Why Shiddy?**

Any intentionally cool sounding names have always felt cringy. At some point shiddy stuck when playing a game with friends and I always thought it was more funny, and more suited in my efforts of thumbing my nose at all the aliases online. 

## About Me

<img src="{static}/images/about-me.gif" style="float: right; width: 15%"> I find a lot of gratification in learning new things, and distilling that information for others. I've always loved technology since I was a kid. Consequently, most of my life has been around trying to get computers to do what I want. If you feel even remotely the same way, you might find something to empathise with here, or you can contribute to the things that I work on on my Github page. 

I have some higher education in computer science and have been working in industry for a few short years, working a myriad of jobs from Support, Stack Developer, to a Security Engineer. If you want to hire me, you can reach out to me on Linkedin. Otherwise feel free to reach out to the email in the footer below.
