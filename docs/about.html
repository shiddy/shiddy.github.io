<p>I initially started this blog so that I could have some stored documentation that I was doing something important with my time. However, in time it's turned into a place for me to express to others things that I am passionate about, or what I've been thinking about. </p>

<p><em>What you might find here</em></p>

<ul>
<li>My musings on living in a computing world</li>
<li>Expressing computer concepts in a way that a younger me would have grasped</li>
<li>Efforts in computing I want to share</li>
<li>Things my future self won't want to look up</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Shiddy?</strong></p>

<p>Any intentionally cool sounding names have always felt cringy. At some point shiddy stuck when playing a game with friends and I always thought it was more funny, and more suited in my efforts of thumbing my nose at all the aliases online. </p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p><img src="assets/about-me.gif" style="float: right; width: 15%"> I find a lot of gratification in learning new things, and distilling that information for others. I've always loved technology since I was a kid. Consequently, most of my life has been around trying to get computers to do what I want. If you feel even remotely the same way, you might find something to empathise with here, or you can contribute to the things that I work on on my Github page. </p>

<p>I have some higher education in computer science and have been working in industry for a few short years, working a myriad of jobs from Support, Stack Developer, to a Security Engineer. If you want to hire me, you can reach out to me on Linkedin. Otherwise feel free to reach out to the email in the footer below.</p>
